Packages needed:
1. Python 2.7
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. sudo apt-get install python-tk


In order to run the program please install the packages mentioned above and then follow the steps below:

1. Extract the files from the .zip and ensure that Test.py, HingeLoss.py and LogisticRegression.py are in the same folder.
2. Right click on Test.py and click run.
3. Follow the prompts on the console and the classifier will start training and display the data after it is done with classification.
4. At the end you have a choice if you want to continue to perform the classification again.


The learning rate for the classifiers are set to 0.01 as default. You can edit the first argument passed to the method at line 87 and 90.

We have divided the data set in the ratio of 80:20 where 80% is the training data and 20% is the testing data.

You can browse through the code and read the comments to see how we implemented each loss function.
